# PCB_Defects
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is the core and basic component of electronic products, exists in almost every electronic product in our daily life.
PCB manufacturing process is complex and cumbersome, which may lead to various defects of PCB, so the detection of PCB becomes an important part of its production process, However PCB manufacturing is primarily hampered by quality control, reliability testing, root cause analysis, image recognition and manual reworking of defective boards. Two factors help to clarify the main points of understanding of modifications made to the model is that to improve the feature extraction capabilities of the model, the convolution block attention module is embedded in the backbone network; And a model network is enhanced by adding a more detailed detection scale, which expands detection range and improves PCB small defect detection effectiveness. The model training part uses the PCB-DATASET dataset. A variety of machine learning models are available for PCB defect detection, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Faster R-CNNs, GANs, and YOLO V5s. 
In this project, the aim is to improve or check the dataset using better algorithms than Yolov5 so that the model can be more accurate and robust and applicable to real-world situations.
